*rest-nvim* rest.nvim - A simple HTTP client for Neovim

INTRODUCTION
rest.nvim is an HTTP client where requests are created using Vim buffers. It includes a simple markup language to define the parameters of an HTTP request.

To get started run :checkhealth rest to ensure you have all the requirements installed.

    :SendRequest Parses the contents of the current buffer and sends a request
    with it

    :RestSave Saves the contents of the current request or response buffer to
    a file that can be passed in as a an argument to the command
